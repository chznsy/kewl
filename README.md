hello. welcome. today, we will be educating the oblivious and unaware people on how to lead a healthy lifestyle.
-step 1: never wake up. when you wake up, you'll have to face the struggles of life and the pressure of planning for your future.
nono, cut all that negativity out of your life sweetie. breathe, live!
-step 2: eat whatever you want. when you are denied the goodies of life, you become sad and depressed.
without having the means to adapt to this suddden change in your life, you become skinny, bony, nothing. 
do you want to become nothing? no. hence, do not reject food. eat whatever you like.
all right, thank you for joining us today. till next time!
